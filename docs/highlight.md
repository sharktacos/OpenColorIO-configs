Both the Filmic and Neutral looks handle warm light temperatures such as sunshine, fire, and tungsten light bulbs differently than the ACES RRT which renders these in an unnatural over-saturated way. Both the Filmic and Neutral Look Transforms therefore slightly lower the saturation in the image highlights, using the [ZoneSatLog Nuke tool](https://community.acescentral.com/t/look-transforms/3885/39). This gives luminous things like the fire and light bulbs, seen in the images below, a more natural appearance compared to the ACES Output Transform:

This flourescent "yellow highlighter" look can be particularly unpleasant in clouds.
