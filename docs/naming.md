# VFX Show Project Directory Structure and Naming Conventions

## Directory Structure

For VFX shows, the project directory is divided into **comp/** and **CG/** folders. Within **CG/** this is further divided into an **assets** folder for the modeling, rigging, and lookdev departments, and a **shots** folder for the animation, FX, and lighting departments. Additionally we have the **textures**, **farm**, and **publish** folders.

## Maya and Substance Painter

Below is the Maya workspace.mel file for a project. We use this in two ways:

Texture phase First, at the beginning of a project artists will have their project located on their home drive (the Z drive), but the render goes to a central location. That way we can review the work in RV for dailies.

Lighting phase Second, once we have lots of textures made we put these in the main project drive and set the project to there. Artist will still save their Maya scenes on their home drive (Z drive), but because the project is set to the central drive the textures will read from there and thus don't need to be copied to each home drive redundantly. This saves a ton of file space.

The Maya scene file is set to "temp" in the project here so the batch render can write a temp file to the artist's home drive (Z drive) which has read/write permissions. The main drive only has read permission so things for safety (note: the farm does not need to do this, just the batch render). Again, this is just for the batch temp file, the artist's Maya scene files themselves should be saved to the appropriate assets or shots folder on their home drive (Z drive).

```
```

## Shot and Asset Naming Conventions

**ASSET NAME** If an *asset name* consists of multiple words (for example "bottle rocket") this should be written as one word without underscores, using capital letters for seperation (bottleRocket).

**SHOT NAME** A *shot name* is composed of *fields* seperated by underscores. 

The following is based on the [Netflix VFX Shot and Version Naming Recommendations](https://partnerhelp.netflixstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057627473-VFX-Shot-and-Version-Naming-Recommendations)

**shot fields**

- showID

    A 2-3 character abbreviation for the project name.
    Example: AGM = A Great Movie
    Usage: Required for series projects (except optional for IO). Optional for all other project types.                                                  

- sequence

    A sequence is a 2-3 character abbreviation for a collection of scenes that are considered a VFX sequence. Sequences can also be assigned to numbers.
    Example: TCC = The Car Chase
    Usage: Optional. (Not all projects get broken down by sequence)

- scene

    Scene number from the portion of the script that a VFX shot came from. Usually appears on the slate.
    Example: 067 = shot comes from scene 67
    Usage: Optional but required if project naming does not use sequences.
    Note: Sometimes scene numbers will appear with letters appended to them to indicate inserted scenes, camera setups or plate shoots. Letters can be ignored for shot naming purposes. It's usually simpler to manage shot names without including any scene letters for overall consistency of file naming.

- shotID#

    3-4 digit identifying number assigned chronologically by sequence or by scene.
    Numbers are typically assigned chronologically by sequence or scene and usually increments by 10s, so if a VFX shot is later identified between ID 0010 and ID 0020 it can be given an ID in between, such as 0015
    Example: 0010 = shotâ€™s assigned ID number is 0010 
    Usage: Required.
    
So for a show with no sequences the shot name would consist of ```showID_scene_shotID#``` for example ```AGM_067_0015```
