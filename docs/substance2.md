# Substance Painter 

*dodge and burn*
Substance does not have a dodge and burn brush like Photoshop or Mari does. Dodge and burn come from photography development and thus affect exposure (i.e. linear gain). 
The idea for painting is that we want to darken a color (burn), rather than painting black on top of it and brighten a color (dodge) rather than adding white on top. That is we want to retain the color and brighten or darken it.

**Burn (darken color)**
Our work-around is to create a layer to darken the color layers below, setting the layer mode to "Soft Light." You then paint black. 


mode with black color to burn (darken). white color works for dodge (lighten), but using "value" mode with retain saturation.
