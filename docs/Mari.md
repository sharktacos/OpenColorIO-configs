# Mari

In Mari our OCIO config is loaded in the Settings

Users should additionally set the color picking mode in the Mari prefs to “color picking” rather than OCIO. This will allow for picking of raw colors (which we need to avoid having colors over 1 in our albedo textures), but viewing the color swatches adjusted to how they will appear in the display space.
