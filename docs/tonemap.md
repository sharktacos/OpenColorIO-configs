# Tonemapping Contrast

Neutral Look is intended as a neutral starting point for color grading and lookdev work. It reduces contrast (by a factor of 0.85 in log space) pulling the shadows and highlights slightly out of the toe and shoulder curves, to make more of the shot range visible.
Filmic Look is intended for shot work and has a similar filmic look to the standard ACES 1.0 RRT, with a little less contrast, resulting of less crushing of shadows.
