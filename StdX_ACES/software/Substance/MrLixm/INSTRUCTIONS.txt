# LUT FOR SUBSTANCE PAINTER

1. PICK THE DESIRED LUT:
	Choose what is going to be your working space.
	
	- sRGB : you don't change your workflow , you just have to convert your color textures before rendering .
- ACEScg: colorpicker thumbnails are going to be off, smartmat/mat with color value will need to be adapted to ACEScg, ... but you will output an ACEScg texture.
	
	Choose the lut corresponding to the desired ODT
	If you are working with the rec709 ODT in all your DCC then pick the LUT that end with out.rec709
	
2. Import the LUT
	Drag and drop the LUT into the SubstancePainter Shelf , import it as a colorLut, and you can import it in your shelf (option at the bottom right) to always have it.
	
3. LUT SETUP
	In the Display Settings window go to the *Activate Post effect* check box and tick it.
	Open the Tone Mapping sub-menu (tick it also) and set the function from *Linear* to **Log**
	Set the mapping factor to the maximum 63.99
	Scroll to the *Activate Color Profile* and tick it.
	Click on profile and select the LUT you imported 

You are done !

# DETAILS FOR ACEScg WORKING SPACE

When working with ACEScg primaries you had to always take the shaded viewport as a reference of the final output. If you pick a color and you look at the colorpicker thumbnail it will not look the same as the color displayed in the viewport and that's normal.

Also if you display only one channel in the viewport (the diffuse color for example) the LUT will not be applied so the colours are going to be off.

And of course if you use color preset like you use a gold substance material you will have to convert the gold color to ACEScg (using Nuke or whatever, you can also  just colorpick it again)
